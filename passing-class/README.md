•    Why did you choose this subject and how were you first made aware of it?
-We chose React Native because it creates mobile apps using JavaScript and React combined. React Native can be imported just as React, styled components, etc. We have not learned about it just yet directly, but were made aware of it briefly through class and also during research while completing Project 3.

•    What problem does it solve and how (conceptually)?
-Combines native application development with JavaScript to provide access to mobile controllers, which allows the native look and feel to the mobile apps.

•    Why does one use it? Any alternatives or what is it similar to?
-Very easy to deploy mobile apps and make use of JavaScript and React. Alternatives: everything else that is not React Native :relaxed: - jQuery mobile, GitHub Electron, Flutter, etc.

•    History of React Native:
-Started as Facebook’s internal hackathon project in 2013. React Native became open and available by Facebook in 2015. React is constantly updated with a two-week train release. Microsoft and Samsung committed to bringing React Native to Windows, for example.

•    Opinion on the technology:
-Very straight forward with the use of components

•    Hurdles:
-Syntax and logic

•    Resources recommended for interested students:
-“Learn the Basics” on github docs, stack overflow questions

•    3 interview questions:
-Explain some of the fundamental tradeoffs between building a React Native app and a true native app
-What is the relationship between React Native and React?
-How does React Native achieve native performance for some of its animations?
